The initialization of this repository. CKEditor 5 collaboration core was extracted from the CKEditor 5 collaboration package. It contains a plugin that supports [user handling](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/users.html) which is a common part for two collaboration features: [real-time collaboration](https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/real-time/) and [comments](https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/comments/).
