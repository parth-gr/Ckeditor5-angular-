# CKEditor 5 comments

[CKEditor 5 comments](https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/comments/) is a collaboration feature that makes it possible to add comments to any part of rich-text content in CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG editor, including text and block elements such as embedded media or images.

Comments can be added, edited, deleted and replied to, allowing the users to collaborate on the same document directly in the rich-text editor. Comments are also integrated with the [track changes feature](https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/track-changes/), so you can add comments to change suggestions.

The comments data can be stored together with the content in your database or it can be synchronized immediately between collaborating clients as a part of the [CKEditor 5 real-time collaboration](https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/real-time/) solution.

Comments can be [displayed](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/comments/comments-display-mode.html) in three modes:
- Wide sidebar:

- Inline balloons:

Additionally, it is possible to turn the editor to the [comments-only mode](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/comments/comments-only-mode.html), where the users can add comments to the document but are not allowed to edit its content directly.
