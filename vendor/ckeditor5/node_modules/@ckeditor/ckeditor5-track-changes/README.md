# CKEditor 5 track changes

[CKEditor 5 track changes](https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/track-changes/) is a collaboration feature that makes it possible to track every change done by the user, mark the changes in the WYSIWYG editor content and show as suggestions.

The user is able to track all basic actions available in the rich-text editor, including:
* Typing, deleting, splitting, merging blocks,
* Inline formatting (bold, italic, etc.),
* Inserting images,
* Block formatting (lists, headers, block quotes, etc.),
* Table manipulations (inserting or removing rows and columns, splitting or merging cells, etc.).

They can also approve or reject individual changes, all selected changes or all changes together.

CKEditor 5 will automatically merge adjacent suggestions done by the same user and ensure that the users are not able to overwrite suggestions created by others as long as they have no full editing permissions.

It is also possible to [comment](https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/comments/) on suggested changes.

Suggestions can be [displayed](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/comments/comments-display-mode.html) in three modes:

- Wide sidebar:
