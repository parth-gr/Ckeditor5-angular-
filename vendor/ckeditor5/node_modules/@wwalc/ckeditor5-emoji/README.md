The plugin was created during hackathon, it is roughly based on the source code of the link plugin. It basically inserts Unicode emoji into the editor at the current cursor position.

## CKEditor 5 compatibility

The plugin was built on top of the latest stable version of CKEditor 5 (`v11.0.1`).

## ðŸ˜Ž Enabling the emoji plugin

Since this is a third-party plugin, it is not enabled by default in CKEditor 5 and has to be added to it manually. For more information check the official documentation about [creating custom builds](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/custom-builds.html).

To install it, run:

```
npm install --save @wwalc/ckeditor5-emoji
```

When updating the build configuration use the following:

 * `@wwalc/ckeditor5-emoji/src/emoji` â€“ plugin import path
 * `Emoji` â€“ plugin name
 * `emoji` â€“ toolbar item (button)

### Development environment

To enable the plugin you amy also setup a local [development environment](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/contributing/development-environment.html) and build a custom editor there.

## Configuration

The list of Emojis is configurable via `config.emoji`:

```js
import Emoji from '@wwalc/ckeditor5-emoji/src/emoji';

ClassicEditor
    .create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
        plugins: [
            Essentials,
            Paragraph, Heading, Bold, Italic, List, Emoji
        ],
        emoji: [
            { name: 'smile', text: 'ðŸ˜€' },
            { name: 'wink', text: 'ðŸ˜‰' },
            { name: 'cool', text: 'ðŸ˜Ž' },
            { name: 'surprise', text: 'ðŸ˜®' },
            { name: 'confusion', text: 'ðŸ˜•' },
            { name: 'crying', text: 'ðŸ˜¢' }
        ],
        toolbar: [ 'heading', 'undo', 'redo', 'bold', 'italic', 'emoji' ]
    } )
    .then( editor => {
        window.editor = editor;
    } )
    .catch( err => {
        console.error( err.stack );
    } );
```
